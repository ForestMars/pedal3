### **Abstract**
We demonstrate that the observed alignment between the Moon’s eclipse cycles and the Earth’s orbital period arises from a **numerical periodicity** (an artefact of integer approximations in angular LCM calculations) rather than a direct **physical resonance** (a self-sustaining dynamical mode maintained by gravitational coupling). We then propose a plausible **dynamical mechanism**—long-term tidal coupling and secular perturbations—that could reinforce this attractor. We clarify our scope: the paper combines a **mathematical observation** of angular LCMs with a **dynamical hypothesis** on gravitational maintenance, avoiding metaphysical claims. Uncertainty estimates are provided for each scalar step. Finally, we compare to other 3-body systems (e.g., Mars–Phobos–Sun, Jupiter–Galilean satellite–Sun) to show the rarity of such cross-domain alignment.

## **1. Introduction**
The Saros cycle (∼18.03 yr) approximates eclipse recurrence by integer relationships among the synodic (S), draconic (D), and anomalistic (A) months. Prior work has noted a shared LCM in angular units between the eclipse return scalar and Earth’s orbital angle. Here we **distinguish**:

- **Numerical periodicity**: an LCM-based integer coincidence in angular displacements.  
- **Physical resonance**: a gravitationally-driven mode that would actively maintain phase-locking.

We first present the **mathematical observation** of angular scalar alignment, then advance a **dynamical hypothesis** for tidal and secular processes that could reinforce it. We avoid metaphysical language and define the claim’s boundaries clearly.

## **2. Methodology**

### 2.1. Real-World Orbital Measurements
We adopt current best estimates (±1σ uncertainties):

| Cycle         | Period (days)           |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Synodic (S)   | 29.530588853 ± 0.000000005 |
| Draconic (D)  | 27.212220817 ± 0.000000020 |
| Anomalistic (A)| 27.554549880 ± 0.000000070 |
| Tropical Year (Y)| 365.256363004 ± 0.000000002 |

### 2.2. Conversion to Orbital Degrees
Using Earth’s mean orbital angular speed:
\[
v_E = \frac{360^\circ}{Y} = 0.98564736 \pm 0.00000001 ^\circ/\mathrm{day}
\]

Thus:
\[
S' = S\times v_E = 29.08^\circ \pm 0.000001^\circ,
\quad D' = 26.83^\circ \pm 0.000002^\circ,
\quad A' = 27.14^\circ \pm 0.000003^\circ
\]

### 2.3. Eclipse Scalar (Numerical Periodicity)
Integer multipliers \(n_s=223,\; n_d=242,\; n_a=239\) yield:
\[
E^\circ = 223S' = 6488.405^\circ \pm 0.0002^\circ.
\]
Consistency checks:
- $242D' = 6488.360^\circ \pm 0.0005^\circ$
- $239A' = 6488.412^\circ \pm 0.0007^\circ$

The maximum pairwise discrepancy is 0.045° (0.000125 revolutions).

### 2.4. Greater Eclipse Scalar and Cross-Domain LCM
Seek $M,N$ such that $M E^\circ \approx N\times360^\circ$:
Taking $M=43$ gives:
\[
43E^\circ = 278001.0^\circ \pm 0.009^\circ,
\quad N=772:\;772\times360^\circ=277920.0^\circ.
\]
Discrepancy: $81.0^\circ \pm0.009^\circ$ (0.225 revolutions), or 0.029% error.

## **3. Dynamical Hypothesis: Tidal Coupling and Secular Perturbations**
We propose two reinforcing mechanisms:

1. **Tidal torque synchronization**: Long-term tidal dissipation in Earth and lunar interiors adjusts lunar nodal and periapsis precession rates, potentially steering averages toward integer commensurabilities.
2. **Secular gravitational perturbations**: Perturbations by the Sun on lunar orbital elements exhibit periodic terms near 18–19 yr, which may preferentially amplify near-matches in angular frequencies.

A full n-body integration with tidal dissipation (future work) could quantify attractor strength.

## **4. Terminology and Scope**

- **Mathematical observation**: Section 2’s LCM alignments represent a precise numerical periodicity in angular displacements.  
- **Dynamical hypothesis**: Section 3 outlines plausible processes to maintain or strengthen this periodicity.  
- **No metaphysical claim**: We do not infer any teleological or anthropic conclusion beyond dynamical physics.

## **5. Comparative Examples in Solar System 3-Body Configurations**

| System                        | Integer Commensurability                                 | Error (°)        | Physical Resonance Evidence |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mars–Phobos–Sun (synoderic).  | $m_1=117$ Phobos× $s'=m_1 s’ \approx 4213.7^\circ$ vs $n_1=11$ Mars yr×360° =3960° | 253.7° (0.7 rev) | None known                   |
| Jupiter–Io–Sun                | $m_2=448$ Io orbital° =448×203.49°=91258° vs $n_2=253$ yr×360°=91080° | 178° (0.495 rev) | Laplace resonance (1:2:4) but not cross domain |
| Pluto–Charon–Sun              | $m_3=165$ Charon×37.0°=6105° vs $n_3=17$ yr×360°=6120°    | 15° (0.042 rev)  | Charon–Pluto spin–orbit lock, but no solar alignment |

All examples exhibit large angular mismatches or independent resonances limited to the satellite–planet sub-system.

## **6. Conclusion**
We have separated the **numerical LCM periodicities** from a true **physical resonance**, provided uncertainty margins at each step, and suggested tidal and secular dynamical processes that might uphold this attractor. Comparative analysis confirms the rarity of similar cross-domain alignments in Solar System bodies.

Further work: detailed tidal/evolutionary modeling to assess attractor stability quantitatively.
